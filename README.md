# Hybrid-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Intrusion-Detection-Systems
This repository contains the code and documentation for our research on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), a critical networking classification task aimed at detecting, classifying, and preventing illicit network traffic. The project focuses on developing and implementing advanced machine learning models to enhance IDS performance.
