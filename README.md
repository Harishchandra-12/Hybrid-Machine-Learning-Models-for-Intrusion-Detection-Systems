# Hybrid-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Intrusion-Detection-Systems
This repository contains the code and documentation for our research on Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS), a critical networking classification task aimed at detecting, classifying, and preventing illicit network traffic. The project focuses on developing and implementing advanced machine learning models to enhance IDS performance.

## Introduction

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) play a crucial role in network security by detecting, classifying, and preventing illicit network traffic. This project explores the development and implementation of a novel hybrid machine learning model that combines the strengths of Logistic Regression and Decision Trees. The hybrid model aims to enhance the performance of IDS in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC score.

This folder contains the Jupyter Notebook and PDF report for Hybrid-Machine-Learning-Models-for-Intrusion-Detection-Systems submitted by Harish Chandra Penumati with student ID 2205576. The Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis for the project, while the PDF report provides a detailed description of the work done.


## Features

- **Hybrid Model**: Combines Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier , Decision Tree and Gaussian Naive bayes for robust network traffic classification.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates models based on multiple performance metrics like confusion matrix, ROC AUC Curve etc.
- **Dataset**: Utilizes the NID dataset for training and evaluation. ##http://205.174.165.80/CICDataset/CIC-IDS-2017/Dataset/MachineLearningCSV.zip
